# chat gpt wrapped
## a website with statistics on your chatgpt usage!

i made this website to take advantage of the fact that you can
export your chatgpt data into a json file really easily. i was inspired
by a discussion during an ai ethics class, and i started this project.
the website is definitely barebones, and i want to add more statistics in the future.

### usage
1. go to chatgpt
2. go to settings
3. go to privacy
4. export your data
5. unzip the files
6. upload "conversations.json" from the folder
